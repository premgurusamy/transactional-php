            On signing up with Textlocal, you will be configured a promotional account for sending bulk SMS by default. Textlocal automatically ensures you comply with TRAI regulations and scrubs DND-registered numbers from your recipient list while sending a promotional bulk SMS campaign.
             You will not be charged any SMS credits for these numbers.
          </p>
          <p>If you would like to send transactional SMS such as OTPs, SMS alerts &amp; order confirmations to your customers, contact your account manager or email us at <a href="mailto:support@textlocal.in">support@textlocal.in</a> - we'll guide you through the account conversion process.
            Please check if your messages can be qualified as transactional SMS <a href="https://textlocal.in/mobile-marketing-guides/faq#Regulation">here</a></p>
          <p>We can configure both promotional and transactional accounts to meet your business needs. Depending on the message content being sent, you can choose either the promotional account or the transactional one.</p>
